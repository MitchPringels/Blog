     <h3>Luis D. Ortiz</h3>
  <p>Luis D. Ortiz (born November 13, 1986) is a licensed real estate salesperson working for Douglas Elliman.
Ortiz co-starred as the third participant in the second season of the Bravo reality television series Million Dollar Listing New York, alongside Fredrik Eklund and Ryan Serhant who remained from the prior season, and has continued with Fredrik and Ryan to subsequent seasons.</p>
     <p>Luis D. Ortiz was born in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. He grew up in Guaynabo with his mother, father, and twin brother Daniel. He and his twin brother left Puerto Rico when they were 16 years old. Luis said they were too young to understand why they wanted to leave but they were feeling uncomfortable and suffocated by something. Luis and his brother headed to Florida and left a note to his parents saying, "If I don’t do this, how do I know if it’s going to work or not?" Ortiz said he didn't speak to his mother for the first six or seven months he and his twin were in the U.S. and his mother wanted to "kill" them.</p>
     <p>In 2006, Ortiz moved to New York City to study film direction at the New York Film Academy where he completed the Director’s Program. Upon moving to New York, Ortiz lived in a Jewish community. At the age of 19, he directed and produced Amália, his first film, which won Best Direction in the Puerto Rico Film Festival in 2007. He came back to New York in 2008 to make a second film. Ortiz sought $15,000 from New York restaurants to fund another film and in one night, raised $9,000. The movie was titled The Theater of the Absurd, but he did not like it so he decided not to show it.</p>
